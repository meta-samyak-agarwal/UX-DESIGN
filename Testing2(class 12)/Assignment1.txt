Testing 2nd Assignment
 
 
 
1. Which software development technique is good for the systems that have third party API calls, cron jobs, data exports/imports, etc.,

Ans) The best options are Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and        Microservices Architecture.
    


2. Where does Test Automation fit in the Software Life Cycle? Explain with a diagram.
        
Ans) It falls under the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Testing Phase as:-
        
     Requirements ->  Design -> Development -> Testing(Manual + Automation) -> Deployment
            
        


3. Can we skip the manual testing and why?

Ans) No, manual testing shouldn't be entirely skip beacuse:
    -> Human interaction is necessary for explain testing methods sometimes.
    -> Human judgment is needed for look and feel, usability.
    -> only stable and repetitive test cases benefit from automation.



4. Give the names of the selector(locators)?
Ans)  Selectors / Locators:
    ->  ID
    ->  Name
    ->  Class Name
    ->  CSS Selector
    



5. Describe the Modular Framework.

Ans) The application being tested is divided into distinct modules using a modular testing framework, and test scripts are created separately for each module.

     Benefits:
    ->  Code reusability
    
 

6. Explain the Open source tool.

Ans) Software that has source code that is openly accessible for use, alteration, and distribution is known as an open source tool.

     Test-related examples include:
        ->  Web automation with Selenium
        -> Postman: Testing APIs
        ->  Frameworks for unit tests: TestNG and JUnit
        
        

 7. What is a Hybrid framework?

Ans) In response, a hybrid testing framework combines two or more frameworks, usually:
    
    -> Driven by Data
    -> Driven by Keywords
    


8. Give the Record and Replay Tool a name.
    
Ans) The popular record and replay tool is the Selenium IDE.



9. What distinguishes Cucumber from BDD?

Ans Behavior Driven Development
    BDDA cucumber
    An approach to development
    An instrument that facilitates BDD
    emphasizes teamwork while utilizing simple language
    Gherkin syntax to executable code conversion


    In conclusion, Cucumber is a tool that aids in the implementation of BDD, and BDD  is a methodology.

 10. Can we replace the Manual Regression testing effort from Test automation and how?

    Yes a significant amount of manual regression testing can be replaced by test automation by

    -> Performing repetitive tests in a timely and reliable manner
    -> Minimizing human error
    -> In long-term projects, saving time



11. How many ‘A’s test script has? Explain them.

A test script follows the "AAA Pattern," which consists of three A's:
    -> Arrange the state of the data  for testing.
    ->Action - Act on the data through some method that performs an action.
    -> Assert that the result from acting on that data is what we expect it to be

    This pattern guarantees that tests are clear, understandable, and organized.
